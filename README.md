<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The original version of this product is an application in an existing FileMaker-based system that tracks data records referred to here as “supplementals.” &nbsp;A “supplemental” is a record that tracks a compensation agreement awarded to a staff member in addition to (i.e. supplemental to) their normal staff contract agreement. &nbsp;From the perspective of the district's financial system, these compensation agreements take the form of stipends; each supplemental describes one stipend and it's distribution details. &nbsp;Typically, staff assigned as athletic coaches, project supervisors, assistants, faculty sponsors, and anything in a similar capacity are awarded these stipends.

The overall goal of the project described here is to port this application to a web-based platform, using a data store based on SQLServer to align it with existing and future application development standards for the district. &nbsp;While the existing application being ported is primarily concerned with tracking supplemental awards based on district athletic activities, the scope of this new ported version will be expanded to track other (non-athletic) supplementals as well.
